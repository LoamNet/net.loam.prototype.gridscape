It doesn't have roots and doesn't pull any nutrients from underwater soil or rocks they're on. Instead, the \"roots\" - or holdfasts as they're called - are actually just for anchoring the seaweed."

Those floating bits are actually full of nasty non-air gasses, believe it or not. Plus, it's so sinky because it breaks down into hydrogen sulfilde. Smells like rotten eggs a bit - potent stuff!"
